 Course Synopsis

The students are required to complete a six credit (minimum ten weeks/180 hour long) internship as a part of the course requirement. Industry

is a crucial requirement of the Internship course and this will have to be secured before getting started with the course. The work that the

students perform during the Internship will have to be supervised by the faculty members as well as by representatives from the participating

Industries. The internship experience is expected to enable the students to assist in the resolution of complex problem associated with

Database systems.

At the end of the Internship, the student(s) are required to write a report on their internship work. Such a report needs to be structured

according to the prescribed format. The Report forms a major aspect of the evaluation of the Internship work. 

Goal

Main goal is to assist students in focusing their interests, thus aiding in their professional carrier. It gives students the opportunity to re-

examine their career objectives and explore the variety of opportunities in the field of computer networking.

Preparation
Students, the advisors, and the industry/organization, with which the student team is affiliated, will have to agree on a problem that needs to

be addressed during the internship. An internship is designed by the advisor and the student according to mutual interests, needs and

availability of related industry/organization. To develop a rewarding program, at the beginning of the internship, the advisor and student are

asked to establish an internship plan, in the form of written objectives and goals, and to develop a strategy for attaining those goals. The plan

may include a schedule of activities that need to be carried out in order to reach a solution for the problem being addressed. The internship plan

is not intended to be rigid. Advisor may be unable to assess certain responsibilities until the student demonstrates his or her ability. The plan

should be flexible and subject to revision. The advisor and student should assess the student's progress throughout the term of the internship

both to evaluate the student's performance, and to establish new directions as needed.

Role of the Advisor

Advisors are expected to share their experience, insight, and enthusiasm with the student throughout the internship. They should continually

monitor the progress of the student, assessing written and oral communications and guiding the development of the student's technical and

managerial skills, effectiveness and presentation of self. Advisors are expected to submit a post-internship evaluation of the student's

accomplishments and abilities and of the internship program in general.

Role of the Student


In order for the internship to be a mutually beneficial experience, a student should begin with a definition of his/her objectives and specific

interests for the minimum of 10-week/180 hour period to ensure that appropriate activities and projects are selected by the advisor and the

student. The student will be responsible for the timely completion and professional quality of all activities and projects assigned. The student is

expected to speak frequently with the advisor on his/her progress and interest in other projects, as well as to discuss observations and

questions about meetings, projects and other activities with which he/she is involved.


The student is required to submit to Advisor, within the first two weeks of the internship, a brief plan for the internship.


Internship Group Size and document preparation


?  Each group must be of maximum 4 Students
